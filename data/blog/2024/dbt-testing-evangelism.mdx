summary: A few weeks back, I ran a workshop on testing in dbt at work. It covered the basics of using generic tests, looked at some of the more advanced tests offered by third party packages, and even covered custom test creation. Mostly though, I wanted to convince my colleagues that tests were cool. I thought I'd write about what worked and where people still needed convincing.

## Why testing in dbt is cool

A few weeks back, I ran a workshop on testing in dbt at work. It covered the basics of using generic tests, looked at some of the more advanced tests offered by third party packages, and even covered custom test creation. Mostly though, I wanted to convince my colleagues that tests were cool. I thought I'd write about what worked and where people still needed convincing.

OK, maybe "cool" is going a bit too far but I wanted to convince some of my skeptical colleagues that writing tests for their models _helps_, rather than _hinders_, development. For a bit of background, we are around a year into our dbt journey and are currently maintaining almost 1500 models.
