title: Switching to Linux Mint DE

summary: I'm a long time Debian user but have also been using Ubuntu and Mint for years now. In a previous job, I was able to opt for Linux on my work machine, but it had to be Ubuntu. Since then I'd been running stock Ubuntu on my personal machine too but the warnings about upgrading to 24.04 LTS, I decided to opt for Linux Mint Debian Edition. I thought I'd write about why, and also about how it went.

## Why Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)? 

I'm a long time Debian user but have also been using Ubuntu and Mint for years now. In a previous job, I was able to opt for Linux on my work machine, but it had to be Ubuntu. Since then I'd been running stock Ubuntu on my personal machine too but the warnings about upgrading to 24.04 LTS, I decided to opt for Linux Mint Debian Edition.

Mostly I wanted to get away from Canonical's bloat, the snap ecosystem, and I no longer had a reason to run my work and personal machines on the same OS (unless I bought a mac I guess). I also just think Mint looks a bit cooler. Of course I could run cinnamon on Debian, but felt the Mint guys might have smoothed a few things out for me. Having done a bit of research, the biggest reason not to use LMDE would be having to jump through a few more hoops to get the nvidia proprietary drivers installed but my venerable T480 doesn't have that problem.

## First impressions / steps

Install went fine, everything looks nice and clean.

I quickly did and apt update and an upgrade which took a little while but nothing crazy. I also took a look at the apt sources:

```bash
deb http://packages.linuxmint.com faye main upstream import backport #id:linuxmint_main

deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb http://security.debian.org bookworm-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

I installed git, and vscode, mainly so that I could start writing this file! and chromium (I know)
