With normal life seemingly not in a hurry to return, and cold weather on approach, I thought I'd sign up for Hacktoberfest this year. I didn't want the free t-shirt but it was a good way to get motivated. I ended up doing more work on a couple of my fledgeling projects than anything else but it was fun. I managed to get PRs accepted for [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) and [Gazpacho](https://github.com/maxhumber/gazpacho), a lightweight replacement for Requests and Beautiful Soup written in Python.

I also started working on a couple of projects of my own. One is [pycricinfo](https://github.com/scrambldchannel/pycricinfo) which is a tool for scraping scores and other information from Espn Cricinfo. I had used [python-espncricinfo](https://github.com/dwillis/python-espncricinfo) in the past but was finding that it didn't quite meet my needs so I tried building a similar tool that would (hopefully) be a little more performant and robust. It's a work in progress but it certainly works well enough for me to do the analysis I wanted to do on the 2020 IPL.

Another project I started was [TM1.jl](https://github.com/scrambldchannel/TM1.jl) which is an attempt to create a wrapper for the TM1 API in Julia. It's very much a work in progress but working on it helped satisfy my curiosity about Julia as a programming experience. I will hopefully have time to return to it at some point but I don't have a pressing use case at the moment.

All in all, Hacktoberfest was a great way to motivate myself to write more code. I will certainly look out for similar events going forward, whether or not they're offering free t-shirts. It helps that maintainers were often pro-active about flagging the issues they wanted help on. It shows how powerful a movement open source can be too.
