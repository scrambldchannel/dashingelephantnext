## Wanna put charts in your blog?

I really love charts and wanted to embrace a library for client side visualisation. I've hacked around with a method to use Chart.js with Gridsome and created a simple demo site detailing my progress thus far. It's rough but hopefully it illustrates a way to get started.

Essentially, I created a new Gridsome project, installed a couple of modules and built some examples including using charts in pages, templates and hack in progress to define charts from within markdown files. Netlify made it easy to spin up a [demo](https://hungry-babbage-b374c1.netlify.app/) from my [repo](https://github.com/scrambldchannel/gridsome-chartjs-examples).
