title: Gone with a (TM1) Hot Promoter
date: 2022-10-18
summary: Anyone get The Breeders reference? Nevermind... Meanwhile, the TM1 REST API made hot promotion of TM1 artifacts within easy reach and TM1py made it simple. The days of manually copying files to the prod server are long gone but I've been looking for a happy medium between ad hoc scripts and building a secure tool. This Jupyter Notebook ticks the low effort box but doesn't have many guard rails. But maybe that's OK?
