## The Project

I'm working on a new hobbyist project that involves ingesting and processing the comprehensive cricket data available at [Cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org/). This is an exciting opportunity to work with a rich dataset that covers international cricket, T20 leagues, and domestic competitions going back to 2001.

## What is Cricsheet?

[Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/) provides freely-available structured data for cricket, including:

- **Ball-by-ball match data** for 19,764+ matches
- Coverage of Test matches, ODIs, T20Is, and various domestic leagues
- Data spanning from 2001 (men) and 2003 (women)
- **Register data** with 17,305+ people and 26,896+ identifiers from 12 sources

The dataset covers everything from international fixtures to major domestic competitions like the Indian Premier League, Big Bash League, County Championship, and many more.

## The Technical Stack

For this project, I'm planning to use:

- **dbt (data build tool)** for data transformation and modeling
- **Clickhouse** as the analytical database
- The structured data formats provided by Cricsheet for ingestion

## Why This Combination?

**dbt** will allow me to:
- Transform the raw cricket data into clean, analytical models
- Maintain data lineage and documentation
- Version control my data transformations
- Create reusable models for different types of analysis

**Clickhouse** offers:
- Excellent performance for analytical queries
- Efficient storage for time-series data (perfect for match events)
- Good support for JSON data (useful for the ball-by-ball details)

## What I Hope to Achieve

This project will give me hands-on experience with:
- Building a complete data pipeline from raw data to analytical models
- Working with sports data and time-series analysis
- Implementing dbt best practices in a real-world scenario
- Creating insights from cricket statistics

## Next Steps

The immediate plan is to:
1. Set up the Clickhouse instance
2. Configure dbt for Clickhouse
3. Start with a small subset of data to validate the approach
4. Build initial models for match summaries and player statistics

I'm looking forward to sharing the progress and insights as this project develops. Cricket data analysis has always fascinated me, and having access to such comprehensive data through Cricsheet is a fantastic opportunity to explore the intersection of sports and data engineering.

Stay tuned for updates on the data models, interesting findings, and lessons learned along the way!
